# Understanding URLS & Views in Django<br>
## Monthly Challenge App.
First of all to be gin with, this repo is not yet complete as of this commit of the READMe, <br>I just love a culture of pushing all my code to Github whether ready or not,<br>
Whether at the Begining phase, Midle Phase or End Phase.
#### Continuous INtegration.
As time goes on, I will be able to improve this code to its best.
## Who needs this
This is simple Django code trying to illustrate the simplest way to understand URLS and Function Based views in Django.

### This readme will also be updated as time goes on. Thanks
